JSDoc
  - How to get methods not documented as global?

Accessing HTML elements
  - On line 336-349 I am attaching event listeners to an element property that is returned from the caculator constructor. This feels clunky, is there a better way?

KeyFlash
  - Clicking and keypress produce the same effect, a flash, worth optimizing?


Things to do
* move the functions into prototypes

* remove all the duplicate IDs

- class name that is a clickable button

- document.activeElement for keypress and then not on the entire page

- Change line 32 to select by class name not ID, multiple same IDs are an issue.
