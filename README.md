##About:
  I am currently living in Madison WI with my beautiful wife and two dogs! I am currently accepting freelance work so don't hesitate to get in contact!

##Services:
###FRONT END DEVELOPMENT
  Front end development about building the visual components of a website. Using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery, I build fast, interactive websites.

###UI/UX DESIGN
  This involves planning and iterating a sites structure and layout. Once the proper foundation is in place I design and build the visual layer to create a responsive and engaging user experience.

###PROJECT MANAGMENT
  Managing a Project Team takes a special blend of management skills and technical experience. Utilizing Agile methodologies such as Scrums and Rapid Prototyping I facilitate remote and local teams to reach their milestones.
